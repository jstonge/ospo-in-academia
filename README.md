# OSPO in Academia

A small prototype of a book to familiarize myself with the following:

 - [svelte-exmarkdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-exmarkdown)
 - More Svelte 5
 - Hosted with Github Pages, using vercel [static adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static)
 - Using [Scrolly.svelte](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter/blob/main/src/components/helpers/Scrolly.svelte) throughout, for interactivity baked in the book itself.

The book addresses open source challenges in academia that, in my opinion, tend to be overlooked in the literature.
