How projects can get out of hand. How taking the time of building reproducible pipeline might get in the way of publishing papers. Dealing with institutional inertia, even though everybody might be on board with open source.\n\nWe identify key challenges:\n- How can we best spread best coding practices, given the above considerations\n- What should we adapt from industry, but perhaps more importantly, what not to bring from industry\n- Building sustainable practices in an academic environment\n- ..."

A project with one or few components have less dependencies and less code associated with ith. But...\n- **Team complementarity**: Complexity depends on the different sets of expertise on a team. The same component can be written such that it is simpler for more experienced individuals\n- **Iteration loops**: Some aspect of the projects cannot be known in advance. This is sometimes inevitable. "

The client is the MAP2LE team.\n\nThe MAP2LE team reached out to the RSE to help design an interactive map where it would be possible to look at probability of infections, given different states (the vector disease, weather, time of the year, etc). The RSE provided a draft of the interactive map that could be achieved, which was put in the draft sent for grant. This draft map was done in less than an hour."

That said, the RSE identified two aspects of the project that could be more time consuming to implement, based on his experience. \n- Making sure the Application Programming Interface has access to hourly/daily weather data.\n- The API data should be then used in models developed by the team. The back and forth depending on the particular models used, and predictive performance in this case, could require some more efforts to fine-tune."

This can lead to the project going sideways in a different ways.\n\nThe scope might be 'clear', in the sense that stakeholders know in a vague way what they want, but the expectations are not realists. That is, the 'true' level of expertise or work required to accomplish the projects' goals are beyond current level of expertise. This can be a good learning opportunity for students, an important source of frustation, or both.\n\nConsider a case where the MAP2LE team didn't realize, but the data is ungainly and large. As such, the data pipeline would benefit from building a Postgres database that the web interface could query. Furthermore, it wasn't clear before, but the model the MAP2LE team had in mind won't work, or perhaps the inference they want to make are not doable, given the data they currently have. A student could take on herself to fix both problems, leading to unreasonable level of expectations, while stakeholders don't see the effort required in fixing both problems. Setting up a database is a nontrivial task to do when it is a first time, especially when students are not coming from a computer science background."

The client is Wikimedia.\n\nThe precise aims of this project are somewhat fuzzy, but the idea is to help Wikimedia to highlight facts about their data using methods from the institute. It is multifaceted, and part of the project is to design what methods will work best on Wikimedia data, and communicate the results effectively. As such, there are milestones and regular check up on advancements, but there is no clear agreed deliverable at the project onset. It is an ongoing discussion. That said, there are a few steps that were understood to be more or less involved upon accepting the research proposals:\n\n- There is \"backend\" effort involved, as the data is voluminous and require database work to manage effectively.\n- There is also \"frontend\" effort involved, as part of the missions for this project is to highlight results that are unique to both the Wikimedia data and the complex systems approach.\n- In between, there is \"research\" effort involved, as the RSEs are expected to contribute to the design of methods that will shape both the backend and frontend aspects of the work. \n\nAs such, there are multiple dependencies between different parts of the pipeline in this project, making it much harder than specific deliverables."
